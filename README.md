# weather-prediction-ml
A machine learning project to predict rain using real-time weather data and logistic regression.

# 🌦️ Weather Prediction with Machine Learning

This project predicts whether it will rain tomorrow or not, using real weather data and a logistic regression model. It fetches real-time weather features using the OpenWeatherMap API and gives rain prediction based on trained ML model.

## 🧠 Features
- Predicts **Rain Tomorrow** (Yes/No)
- Uses **15 real-time weather features**
- Trained using dataset from **Kaggle**
- Automated prediction using **OpenWeatherMap API**
- Clean and beginner-friendly code 🧼

## 📂 Dataset
- Downloaded from [Kaggle: Rain in Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)
- Preprocessed to remove missing values
- Converted "RainToday" and "RainTomorrow" to 0/1
